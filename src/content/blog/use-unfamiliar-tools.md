You can build your idea with tools you've never used before.

You can write your first version in TypeScript, and then port that to Rust.

You can workshop building your app in an unfamiliar language/framework with ChatGPT.

You can switch the dialect of all the SQL in your codebase from SQLite to MySQL in an afternoon.

You can pick up a new language and be productive.

You can just use the best tools for the job.

You can build your web app using your first choice of web framework, and your mobile app using your first choice of mobile framework. And they can be different.

Believe you can, resist getting bogged down when you get stuck, ask ChatGPT for help, and don't overthink it.
